            <p>An international school is an institution that promotes education in an international environment or framework. Although there is no uniform definition or criteria, international schools are usually characterized by a multinational student body and staff, multilingual instruction, curricula oriented towards global perspectives and subjects, and the promotion of concepts such as world citizenship, pluralism, and intercultural understanding.[1] Many international schools adopt a curriculum from programs and organizations such as International Baccalaureate, Edexcel, Cambridge Assessment International Education, International Primary Curriculum, or Advanced Placement.

                International schools often follow a curriculum different from the host country, catering mainly to foreign students, such as members of expatriate communities, international businesses or organizations, diplomatic missions, or missionary programs. Admission is sometimes open to local students to provide qualifications for employment or higher education in a foreign country, offer high level language instruction, and/or foster cultural and global awareness.[2]
                
                History
                The first international school can be traced back to the International School of Geneva founded in 1924 by Arthur Sweetser and Ludwik Rajchman with an emphasis on bilingual education (English and French). Later that year the Yokohama International School was also established in Yamate, Naka-ku, Yokohama, Japan.[3] These schools catered to children of expatriate families. These could include diplomats, missionaries, military members, business workers transferred to foreign office locations, etc.
                
                An example would be children of American military personnel attending Department of Defense Dependents Schools (DoDDS).
                
                Criteria
                At a conference in Italy in 2009, the International Association of School Librarianship came up with a list of criteria for describing an international school, including:[4]
                
                Transferability of the student's education across international schools
                A moving population (higher than in state schools or public schools)
                Multinational and multilingual student body
                An international curriculum
                International accreditation (e.g. Council of International Schools, International Baccalaureate, Western Association of Schools and Colleges, etc.)
                A transient and multinational teacher population
                Non-selective student enrollment
                Usually English language of instruction, plus the obligation to take on at least one additional language
                However, there are also disagreements amongst educators on what the exact criteria should focus on. Factors such as international history, culture, and perspective within the education curriculum would also make a school "international". Although the nationality of students plays a big part, the manner in which the education is delivered is just as important.[5]
                
                Languages of instruction
                While English-language international schools are the most numerous, many international schools teaching primarily in other languages exist.
                
                For instance, there are 140 "German Schools Abroad" which are accredited and partly funded by the German federal government through the Central Agency for German Schools Abroad (Zentralstelle für das Auslandsschulwesen), and teach a curriculum at least partly based on German schools. According to the German Foreign Office, the government's support of these schools "helps to overcome cultural barriers, to convey a modern, diverse image of our country and to strengthen German language skills in other countries."[6]
                
                Other examples of non-English international schools include:
                
                French schools abroad accredited by the French government's Agency for French Education Abroad (Agence pour l'enseignement français à l'étranger).
                Nihonjin gakkō - Japanese-language schools accredited by the Japanese government's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
                Curriculum
                Curricula in English-language international schools are most often based on education in the United Kingdom, education in the United States, or curricula specially designed for international schools such as the International General Certificate of Secondary Education or the IB Diploma Programme. These international curricula are committed to internationalism, developing the global citizen, providing an environment for optimal learning, and teaching in an international setting that fosters understanding, independence, interdependence, and cooperation.
                
                Like other schools, international schools teach language arts, mathematics, the sciences, humanities, the arts, physical education, information technology, and design technology. More recent developments specifically for primary school include the IB Primary Years Programme (PYP) and International Primary Curriculum (IPC). Secondary education is provided through the relaunched IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) and redeveloped International Middle Years Curriculum (IMYC). Most recently, the launch of the International Early Years Curriculum (IEYC) in 2016 has provided an international curriculum for early years learners aged 2–5, growing to 500 schools and early years settings between 2016 and 2021. In 2013 there were 3063 schools offering the international baccalaureate curriculum in the world [7] and over 1000 schools offering the IEYC, IPC, and/or IMYC around the world.[8]
                
                The curriculum could also be based on the school's origin country. Schools that are a part of the International Schools Consortium (iSC) deliver an International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) curriculum. This is the standard curriculum for American schools. High school education includes core classes such as English, Foreign Languages, Mathematics, Physical Education, Science, Social Studies, Fine Arts, with the addition of ESL (English as a second language) classes for students who may need. In addition, students may select Advanced Placement (AP) programs to prepare for college-level education, specifically in the United States.
